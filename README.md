This repository contains a mini-project that dives into the analysis of alcoholic beverage consumption across various countries. The analysis was done using a Jupyter notebook, leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Data Description

The dataset comprises several attributes:

- `country`: Name of the country.
- `beer_servings`: Number of beer servings on average.
- `spirit_servings`: Number of spirit servings on average.
- `wine_servings`: Number of wine servings on average.
- `total_litres_of_pure_alcohol`: Total average liters of pure alcohol consumed.
- `continent`: Continent to which the country belongs.

## Analysis Highlights

1. **Data Processing with Pandas and Numpy**: Initial data cleaning, wrangling and transformation to prepare it for analysis.
2. **Statistical Metrics Computation**: Computed metrics that provide insights into the average, median, and other statistical measures of alcohol consumption.
3. **Visual Analysis with Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Created a range of visuals to better understand the distribution, patterns, and trends in the data. This includes bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more to represent the consumption habits across different continents and countries.

## Getting Started

To dive into the analysis, you can open the Jupyter notebook provided in this repo. Ensure you have Jupyter installed and the necessary libraries. You can install them using pip:

pip install `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `jupyterlab`


This will open up Jupyter Lab where you can find the notebook and run it interactively.
